# Barcode-Detector
This project demonstrates a classical computer vision approach to detecting barcodes in images using image thresholding, edge detection, and morphological operations. The Python notebook provided walks through each step of the process, from loading and preprocessing the images to applying various filters and finding contours to detect barcodes.
